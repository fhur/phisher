Simple phishing detection based on twitter api


Phishing detection
------------------
This project aims to provide an extremely simple heuristic approach to phishing
detection. The hypotheses is that a site's reputation will grow over time
if the site is 'real' while phishing sites will not. The reputation can be
measured using the site's activity on twitter. A phishing site will most likely
have little to none twitter activity while a real site like facebook, gmail,
will have followers and tweets every single day.
